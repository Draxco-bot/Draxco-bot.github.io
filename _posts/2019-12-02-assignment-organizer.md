A website that would automatically sort your assignments by the date they are due and provide a suggested date to start studying. All a student will need to do is insert there syllabi into the website and it will scan through and find when each assignment is due and put them on a calendar. Based on the percentage each assignment/test is worth it will give a 2-7 day time period to start working on the assignment or study for the test.
