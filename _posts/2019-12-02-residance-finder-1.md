I created a project where it will help students find a place to stay. When coming to university or college away from home the first year is pact with new events that students have to get use too. New school, new people and probably a new city or even a new country. Students in there first year have to adapt to new changes, and after a few months of people at school, a student has to start looking for a place to stay for their up coming years. This website should make the process simpler for new students, it will be a one way stop for both the landlords and students to connect share information with potential landlords.
